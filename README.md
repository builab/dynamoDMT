# dynamoDMT v0.2b

Filament analysis using Dynamo

For doublet MTD, make sense to have a script aa_axonemeIntraAvg.m to generate the average of all dmt from same axoneme to quickly check for polarity
Alternatively, make a script, aa_correctFlaDirection.m to fix all the models to the right orientation before running.
